### Future Projects

- Modder Map - Trigger Tutorials
  - This will be an additional Modder Map that gives working examples of all trigger conditions and effects. Coming soon!
- Plane of Elemental Chaos
  - This will be an AoE2 random map script based on the Terrain Blending map listed above.
- Team vs Team RTS Game (Working title: Icehouse)
  - This will be a unique team vs. team custom map based on the popular chess variant called bughouse. I'm planning to make this as a mod for Frost Giant's upcoming RTS game and incorporate some of the mechanics from Wargame Theory - Blood Sacrifice (1v1 mode).
